Welcome to the home of the Starburst Galaxy Hands-on SA Workshop!

**What is the Galaxy Hands-on Workshop you ask?**

The Galaxy Hands-on Workshop is a set of modules designed to be utilized by Starburst technical resources on-site with prospects or customers interested in hands on learning of the Starburst Galaxy platform. Begin with Module 0, which is the pre-work / setup module that provides a blueprint and recommended path on how to prepare for the on-site engagement. After you have checked out Module 0, move on to the content modules to determine which you would like to utilize during your on-site. Each module is designed to take up to an hour, give or take.

Each module comes with a set of slides that are linked at the top of each modules readme.

**Recommended order of operations for the modules should be as follows:**
