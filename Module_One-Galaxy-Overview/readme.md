Module 1 is the Basic Starburst Galaxy overview module. The module is designed to provide an introduction to the Galaxy SaaS platform for your lab attendees. 
The module will cover the following areas:

- Basic Galaxy Architecture [5-10 Mins] Slides
  - We recommend walking through this section with the pre-built slides. Referrence "Galaxy Architecture" PDF in this directory.
- Galaxy Usecases [5-10 Mins] Slides
  - In Development
- Galaxy UI Walkthrough [10 Mins] 
  - We recommend walking through Galaxy UI Live by sharing your screen and driving through the UI. A "how-to" video provided in UI Overview Folder.

- Cluster Overview [10 Mins] Demo/Slides

- Have the users login to the pre-configured domain

- How to create a Catalog [10 Mins] Demo/Slides
  - Reference "Create S3 Catalog" PDF in this directory for your demo
  - Reference "Create Database Catalog" PDF in this directory for your demo

To squeeze all of the above topics into the first hour, we have intentionally not had the lab attendees login to Galaxy yet and be distracted during this overview. At the end of the overview module, they can login and this will mark the transition to Module 2.
